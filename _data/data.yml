education:
    title: Education
    info:
      - degree: Bachelor of Computer Science
        university: Dalhousie University
        time: 1999 - 2004
        details: |
          Started in Earth Science before finding logic and Computer Science. I enjoyed many
          challenging courses in progamming, computer graphics, artificial intelligence, operating
          systems, and algorithms. My longtime interest in mapping, image & signal processing eventually led me 
          back to Earth Science taking courses in Remote Sensing & GIS in my third/fourth year. In my third
          year I did a Co-Op term split between Bedford Institute of Oceanography, 
          where I worked on cleaning/processing Multibeam Backscatter Data, and
          crack-pattern recognition and modelling from mud drying timeseries images 
          in the Surface Pattern & Process Laboratory of Dr. Lawrence Plug.
